# About
This is a C# wrapper application that enables developers to quickly interact with Sharebase, a file storage and sharing solution created by Hyland. This uses their API service to upload documents and share directories.

NOTE! I am not affiliated with Hyland / Sharebase in any way. Do not ask for profesional support using this tool. Understand that this is something I (might) maintain in my free time. You are also free to fork this and improve it so it matches your organization's needs.

I have implemented only a few of the total API endpoints available. I might do more if I have time and am bored.

# Tech

This project uses .NET Core 3.1. 

The SharebaseSharp library is a demo project only. Use the Sharebase.API library in your projects.

# Contributing

Ya just open a PR or something.

# Feature requests
Make an issue in GitHub. I might have time around Christmas to do things but I am currently very busy in my personal life.

# Giving back
If you like this and want to reward me, go buy something on my wedding registry. Should be up for a while longer.
